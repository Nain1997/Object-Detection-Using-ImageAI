# Object-Detection-Using-ImageAI

ImageAI makes use of a pre-trained model and can easily be customized. The Object Detection class of the ImageAI library contains fuctions to perform object detection on any image or set of images, using pre-trained model and it recognize 80 different kinds of common, everyday objects.

REQUIREMENTS --> Download and install Python 3 from the official Python website.

                 pip install keras
                 pip install imageAI
                 Then download the resnet COCO model file that contains the classification model that
                 will be used for object detection
